# ✅ Todo App (JSONPlaceholder API)

A simple yet powerful **Todo Application** built using **Vanilla JavaScript** and a **fake REST API (JSONPlaceholder)**.  
This project demonstrates **CRUD operations**, **async JavaScript**, and **DOM manipulation** in a real-world style setup.

---


## 🧠 What This Project Covers

This project is designed to strengthen core JavaScript concepts:

- Asynchronous JavaScript (`fetch`, `async/await`)
- REST API (CRUD operations)
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Event delegation
- UI state updates
- Clean project structure

---

## ✨ Features

- Fetch todos from API on page load
- Add new todo
- Toggle todo status (completed / not completed) on **single click**
- Delete todo on **double click**
- Visual feedback for completed todos
- Clean and responsive UI

---

## 🔄 CRUD Operations Explained

| Operation | Action | API Method |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Create | Add new todo | `POST` |
| Read | Fetch todos | `GET` |
| Update | Toggle status | `PUT / PATCH` |
| Delete | Remove todo | `DELETE` |

⚠️ **Note:**  
JSONPlaceholder is a **fake API**, so changes are not persisted on refresh.  
All updates are handled on the **UI level for learning purposes**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- JSONPlaceholder API
- Fetch API
- DOM APIs

---


## 📌 How It Works

1. Page loads → todos fetched from API
2. Todos rendered dynamically in DOM
3. User interactions:
   - **Single click** → toggle completed status
   - **Double click** → delete todo
4. API requests simulate real backend behavior
